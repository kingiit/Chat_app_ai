Design:

    Built a chat application with ChatEngine, and Open AI and Chat GPT integration.

    The chat application consists of user registration and authentication feature. The application allows sending  and receiving text messages between users. It has the group chat functionality along with the real time message update.  

    Frontend consists of ChatEngine along with Redux Toolkit for state management as well as for making API calls, while React Router is used for navigation. 

    Node.js was used in the backend and Express.js was used as the backend framework. Also used OpenAI for AI integration with the chat.
